This project was never finished.  
Or maybe it finished before it started.  
Either way, there’s nothing useful here.

If you're here on purpose, the silence might mean something.

## Artistic Concept

Thresholds presents itself as a half-finished doorway—an experiment paused mid-incantation. The mood is liminal and quiet, hinting at systems that were opened and then abandoned. The scattered elements reinforce that feeling: `threshold.yaml` reads like a configuration of unstable states (entropy near critical, attention drifting, time stretched, loop open), while `forgotten.key` hides an encoded link—a reminder that access exists but has been intentionally obscured. Together with the sigils, they imply a story about unlocking perception only if you know where to look.

### Glossary

- **`threshold.yaml`**: A seed-like manifest listing states of entropy, attention, time, and an “open loop,” suggesting an experiment left running.  
- **`forgotten.key`**: A base64-encoded URL (`https://cognisi.io`), acting as a cryptic invitation or misplaced credential.  
- **🜁 ⟁ ⌘**: A trio of sigils found in `Sigil/glyph.txt`; they evoke alchemical and command motifs, hinting at elemental forces, thresholds, and hidden control.
